- There are no known problems in my program, to my knowledge.
- My program creates a stress ball using a random size and color. It then compares it to the stress ball that is
given in the stress_ball_test.cpp
- I ran the program multiple times to ensure that it ran correctly without mistakes using the provided test file. 
I did not use any exceptions for error handling.
