- My code does not have any known problems to my knowledge.
- My program reads in two files. It creates two collections of each file and uses the data from the files
and creates stress balls out of the data. Then, the data is added into the collections previously made.
It then displays the data, sort them by size (can use bubble, insertion, or selection sort), can output the number 
of stress balls that share the same data, such as size or color. It can also create a new collection out of two 
existing collections using  union function. It can also swap two existing collections.
- I created two files that contained data, such as color and size of stress balls. I read in the data and created 
collections for each of them and outputed the data. This checked if my program can read data and create collections. I threw an exception
for the file name just to make sure that the file actually exists. I then implimented a sorting funtion and checked the output to see if they 
sorted correctly. I then checked the size of the collection to ensure that it was the same as the original. I did this for the other two sorting options. 
My sorting enum class has an exception as the default switch case. This is to ensure that the sorting selected is one of the sorts that I implemented.
I then created a this collection and used the union function and outputed the data.
I checked the size of this collection and compared it to the number that I received from counting by hand. Lastly, I called the swap function and 
outputed the data and checked if they swapped correctly. I ensured by outputting the size of the collection and checked if they were the 
same numbers from the original collections, only now they're switched.
- Attached will be my two collection files. My code can easily be changed in order to test different file names or different sorting algorithm.
