- There are no known problems with my code.
- My code begins with allowing the user to select which type of version that they will like to test.
The options are stress ball and jeans. Then, it will read from two files and create a collection of
the users selections. Let's say that the user selected jeans. After reading from the files and creating
a collection of jeans, my code will create a copy of the first input, make a third collection from the 
existing two, it can swap any of the collections, and it can sort the collections by size. The user
has the option of selection stress balls as well and it will do the same and more.
- I tested my program by creating a test file for the jeans, jeans_test.cpp. I already had an existing
test file for my stress balls and I implemented most of my code from there. I then templeted the collection
class and tested it with the stress_ball_test.cpp file that I had created. Once that performed as it should
I moved onto testing my jeans to ensure that it perfoms the same. 
- Templates are pretty useful becuase they allow us to write generic programs. I was able to create 
a simple class and functions that will be able to work with multiple data types. This allows me to save
time and code by replacing multiple classes and funtions by only doing it once using templates.
