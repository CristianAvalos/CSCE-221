- There are no known problems with my code that I know of.

- My code creates a doubly linked lists that that it is templeted. Because of this, you can 
create a dll with any variable that you like. You are able to perform various functions with 
my code. It is able to create a dll, insert at the begining, end, after a node, before a node, and does
the same for remove. 

- I tested my program by creating a main funtion in which I called the functions that I had created
in order to ensure that they performed as they should. The variables that I used for the dll were strings.
I would list out the results and check if I got the same results as I would do by hand. I believe that I had 
tested every function that I created.
