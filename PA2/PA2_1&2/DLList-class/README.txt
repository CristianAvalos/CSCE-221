- There are no known problems with my code that I know of.

- My code creates a doubly linked lists of integers that you can perform various functions with.
It is able to create a dll, insert at the begining, end, after a node, before a node, and does
the same for remove. 

- I tested my program by creating a main funtion in which I called the functions that I had created
in order to ensure that they performed as they should. I would list out the results and check if 
I got the same results as I would do by hand. I believe that I had tested every function that I 
created.
